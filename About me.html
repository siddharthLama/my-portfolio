       Hi, I am Siddharth Lama.
       I live in India .
       I am 13 years old .
       I like coding games and I am currently learning how to create web pages . 
       Throughout my experience of coding games . I have learnt many things . 
       And I would also like to learn more in the coming classes of my coding experience . 
       All this learning of writing these codes is only possible due to the support of my parents and my coding teacher and White Hat Jr.
       Thank You
